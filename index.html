      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Realtor in the state of Florida looking to transition into a new career.  I currently hold a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Florida in Economics and minored in East Asian Languages and Business Administration.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Panama City, Florida.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy mmorpgs.  The one I currently play more than others is Final Fantasy 14.  Aside from that, I also dabble in other things like gardening, sewing, and painting.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to just be a business owner and collect the profits while ensuring the best and correct people are running my companies.  In the mean time, I'll settle for a fun job in which I'm always learning and potentially pays well.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Panama City, FL about 75% of the year and Pensacola, FL the other 25%.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have held positions in a variety of customer service positions, such as restaurant manager, and bank teller, and feel I have that mastered and want to branch into something different.  I thrive in an environment where I don't know everything and can constantly grow and learn.  I know this career would give me that, so I'm interested in seeing how much I'll enjoy it. </p>
